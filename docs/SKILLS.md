# Mesh-preview agent skill

The MCP supplies tools. The optional **firestorm-mesh-preview** skill supplies the importer procedure: source commits, LOD/physics checks, captures and cleanup.

It follows the [Agent Skills format](https://agentskills.io/specification). It adds instructions, not viewer capabilities or permissions. A speed improvement has not been measured.

## Install

1. [Download skill 0.1.1](https://github.com/AochiToxx/firestorm-mcp/releases/download/skill-v0.1.1/firestorm-mesh-preview-0.1.1.zip) and extract it.
2. Import the complete `firestorm-mesh-preview` folder through your host's skill loader or documented skills directory. Keep `SKILL.md`, `references/importer.md` and `LICENSE` together.
3. Configure Firestorm MCP separately, then select the skill and provide your files and requested check.

Example request:

> Compare my High and Lowest exports in the importer. Capture the differences and leave upload for a separate decision.

If the host has no skill loader but can read files, ask it to read `SKILL.md` and the linked procedure. Adding the skill does not require a viewer restart. It does not register the MCP or reduce the host's tool catalog automatically.

## Supported workflow

The procedures were observed on Windows with Firestorm **7.2.4.80712** and MCP **0.3.0a1**. They use the same tools in the current release.

Check `connection_status.local_platform` first. Linux/macOS need manual file selection; the skill does not add native picker adapters or a Pi viewer. See [platform support](PLATFORMS.md).

Format, package and offline instruction checks are separate from live testing. Host-specific automatic activation and a new skill-driven live benchmark remain unverified. [Verification record](VALIDATION.md).

## Improve the skill

Edit [the source folder](../skills/firestorm-mesh-preview) and describe the request, failure and correction in a pull request. Keep API fixes in the runtime and follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Build a standalone ZIP with `python3 scripts/build_skill.py --output-dir dist` (`python` on Windows). It includes both skill documents and the MIT licence. The runtime wheel does not install personal skill files.
